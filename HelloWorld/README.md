# Getting Started
In this chapter, I learned how to install rust on my computer. I also learned how ot build and run projects using the rust compiler and cargo. 

## Commands to remember
```
rustc <filename.rs>
```
This command creates a binary compiled file of the file you provided using the rust compiler.

```
cargo init
```
This command initializes an existing project as a cargo project and creates the needed files for declaring dependencies. 

```
cargo build
cargo run
```
These commands are used to build and run a rust project using cargo. The compiled file will be generated in the target/ directory.
